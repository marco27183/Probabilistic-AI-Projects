For this task, we based the code on the provided paper "Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints" from Gelbart et. al. 
For the implementation of the "acquisition_function" we tested four different approaches, namely GP-UCB and GP-EI (Expected improvement) as well 
as their constraint versions. This means, that we computed the cdf of the constraint under the predicted mu and sigma and deducted a penalty term 
if the probability of not fulfilling the constraint was high. Finally, the solution was found iterating through all possible solutions and only
returning the value if the constraint was fullfilled (based on provided c(x) that was earlier appended to the self.previous_points). For each new datapoint
the gaussian process regression was updated (new .fit(X,y) call) and based on this new fit, the prediction for the next point was computed.
