For this task, we based the code on the provided paper "Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints" from Gelbart et. al. For the implementation of the "acquisition_function" we tested four different approaches, namely GP-UCB and GP-EI (Expected improvement) as well as their constraint versions. This means, that we computed the cdf of the contstraint under the predicted mu and sigma and deducted a penalty term if the probability of not fulfilling the constraint was high.
